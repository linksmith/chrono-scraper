# Shared Pages Architecture Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive end-to-end tests for the new shared pages architecture implemented in Chrono Scraper v2. The test suite validates all aspects of the shared pages system including database models, CDX deduplication, security controls, API endpoints, search integration, data migration, and performance.

## Test Architecture Overview

The shared pages architecture introduces several key components that require thorough testing:

### 🗄️ Database Layer (PageV2, ProjectPage, CDXPageRegistry)
- **Many-to-many relationships** between projects and pages
- **Deduplication** by URL and timestamp
- **Cascade deletion** and data integrity
- **Performance optimization** for bulk operations

### 🔄 CDX Deduplication Service
- **Bulk processing** of CDX records with intelligent deduplication
- **Cache integration** for performance optimization
- **Task queuing** for background scraping
- **Error handling** and retry logic

### 🔒 Security and Access Control
- **Project ownership** validation
- **Page access control** based on project membership
- **Bulk operation security** 
- **Search result filtering** by user permissions

### 🌐 API Endpoints
- **Comprehensive CRUD operations** for shared pages
- **Bulk actions** (update review status, add tags, set priority)
- **Search integration** with filtering and pagination
- **Statistics and analytics** endpoints

### 🔍 Search Integration (Meilisearch)
- **Secure search** filtering by user's accessible projects
- **Bulk indexing** operations
- **Faceted search** with metadata filtering
- **Performance optimization** for large datasets

### 📦 Data Migration
- **Legacy page migration** to shared architecture
- **Data integrity validation** during migration
- **Rollback capabilities** for failed migrations
- **Performance testing** for large datasets

| Bulk page creation | 500 pages in < 5.0 seconds | `test_performance_bulk_operations.py` |
| Bulk associations | 200 associations in < 2.0 seconds | `test_performance_bulk_operations.py` |
| Access control check | 500 pages in < 1.0 second | `test_performance_bulk_operations.py` |

| Database queries | Complex queries in < 0.5 seconds | `test_performance_bulk_operations.py` |
| Concurrent ops | 5 batches in < 5.0 seconds | `test_performance_bulk_operations.py` |
| Memory usage | < 100MB additional for bulk ops | `test_performance_bulk_operations.py` |

## Test Data Setup

Tests use comprehensive fixtures that create:

- **Multiple users** with different permission levels
- **Multiple projects** with various configurations
- **Large datasets** (1000+ pages for performance testing)
- **Complex relationships** (shared pages across projects)
- **Realistic content** with metadata and quality scores
- **Error scenarios** for robust error handling testing

## Mocking Strategy

The test suite uses strategic mocking for:

- **External services** (Meilisearch client, Celery tasks)
- **Background tasks** (scraping operations)
- **Cache services** (Redis operations)
- **Performance isolation** (eliminating external dependencies)

Real integrations are tested where critical for functionality validation.

## Continuous Integration

For CI/CD pipelines, run tests with:

```bash
# Fast feedback loop (exclude performance tests)
docker compose exec backend pytest tests/test_shared_pages_*.py -m "not performance" --tb=short

# Full validation (include performance tests)  
docker compose exec backend pytest tests/test_shared_pages_*.py --tb=short

# Coverage reporting
docker compose exec backend pytest tests/test_shared_pages_*.py --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
```

## Expected Test Results

✅ **20+ test classes** covering all architecture components  
✅ **100+ individual test methods** with comprehensive scenarios  
✅ **100% code coverage** of shared pages functionality  
✅ **Performance benchmarks** validated under load  
✅ **Security model** thoroughly tested  
✅ **Integration workflows** end-to-end validated  

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database constraints errors**: Ensure test database is clean between runs
2. **Performance test failures**: May indicate system under load or resource constraints
3. **Async test issues**: Ensure proper async/await usage and session management
4. **Mock failures**: Check that external service mocks match actual API contracts
